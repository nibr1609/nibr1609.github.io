title: "Measuring Code Difficulty by Examining
Psycho-Physiological Signals"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/codeDifficulty
excerpt: 'This review article that I wrote as part of my second seminar is about how the brain and body react to different difficulty
levels of coding tasks and discuss how biometric signals indicate those levels -
independent of empirical difficulty metrics of code. We propose an experiment to improve on previous results in literature.'
