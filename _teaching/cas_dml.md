I was a Teaching Assistant for the Data Science and Machine Learning module in the CAS DML program at ETH Zürich. My role involved guiding participants—mostly professionals from non-technical backgrounds—through key concepts in data analysis and machine learning. I held two weekly office hours to provide support on assignments, concepts, and coding challenges, and assisted in physical sessions to ensure hands-on learning with Python and data science tools.
