Hey, my name is Niklas Britz and I'm currently a student at [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de/), Germany. 
I specialize in **Cryptography**. I am currently working on my bachelor's thesis, centering around secret-sharing.

From September 2022 to June 2023 I did a study abroad at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), Seattle. 

I am expecting to graduate in March 2024 and hope to start a Ph.D. program in Fall 2024.

This homepage is under construction, I just heard it is cool to have one :)
