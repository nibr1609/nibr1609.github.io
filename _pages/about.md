Hey, my name is Niklas Britz and I'm a first-year master's student at [ETH Zürich](https://inf.ethz.ch), Switzerland. 
I specialize in **Privacy Preserving Systems**. Right now, I am working on the intersection between Cryptography and Machine learning. Before I moved to Zürich, I worked on my bachelor's thesis at [Saarland University](https://saarland-informatics-campus.de) & [CISPA](https://cispa.de/en), centering around secret-sharing.

From September 2022 to June 2023 I did a study abroad at the [University of Washington](https://www.cs.washington.edu/), Seattle. 

This homepage is under construction, I just heard it is cool to have one :)
